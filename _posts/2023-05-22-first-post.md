Hello, my name is Min Kim, and I am currently working as a software engineer in the beginning phase of my career. However, I must admit that imposter syndrome is a real thing. Despite thinking that working hard would be enough, many of my colleagues have talked about it, and mentors have given numerous lectures on the subject. Unfortunately, I have discovered that it is difficult to work hard with this syndrome.

It took me a bit longer than usual to finish my degree at the age of 30, but with additional training and a tremendous amount of effort, I was able to land my dream job as a software engineer. This was during a time when many big tech companies were laying off people, so I was grateful to have been hired despite the difficult circumstances.

However, I soon encountered news about chatGPT and how AI could potentially replace software engineers. This caused me to fear losing my job before I even began working as a software engineer. It's a daunting thought to feel like you're replaceable at your job, especially after putting in all that effort to get to where you are. I have been working as a software engineer for a few months now, but I still fear being replaced. This fear has been affecting my productivity, and I am continuously anxious that I am not good enough and need to do something to prevent being replaced. I cannot rest peacefully because of this fear, and it's starting to take a toll on my mental well-being.

I even consider starting my own business so that I can work for myself and avoid being fired. Starting a business is a huge undertaking, and it's not something I'm entirely sure I'm equipped to do, but the thought of being in control of my own career is comforting. However, I don't want to give up on my current job just yet. I want to explore all my options and try to overcome this fear before making any drastic decisions.

I cannot focus on improving my software engineering skills because I am not sure about this career. This fear is hindering my ability to learn and grow in my field. I need to find a way to overcome this fear and focus on my work. Perhaps finding a mentor who has gone through something similar or seeking out therapy could help me overcome this imposter syndrome.

I know that it will take some time for AI to take over software engineering, but I still feel like I am in a danger zone. The lack of job security in the tech industry is a reality that we all have to face, but it's important to not let that fear consume us. I want to do everything in my power to be the best software engineer I can be, and I won't let this fear stop me from achieving my goals. I believe that with hard work, dedication, and a willingness to learn, I can overcome this imposter syndrome and thrive in my career as a software engineer.
